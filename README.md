# LRU-cache

cacheSim is a simulator for a cache. It takes the following input parameters on the command line: name of the file holding the
loads and stores, cache size (not including tags or valid bits) in KB, associativity, and the block size in bytes. 
The replacement policy is always LRU.

virt2physical converts virtual addresses to physical addresses.
